The sample can be deployed with either docker-compose (v1.20+ required) or docker swarm. The deployment uses the same configuration script.   

### Docker-Compose Deployment

This is as simple as 
```
make start_docker_compose
make stop_docker_compose
```

### Docker Swam Single Machine Deployment

Initialize docker swarm if you have not:
```
sudo docker swarm init
```
Then start/stop services as follows:
```
make start_docker_swarm
make stop_docker_swarm
```

### Docker Swam Multiple Nodes Deployment

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm) to create a swarm. Then setup each swarm node as follows:     
- All swarm nodes must have the same user (uid) and group (gid).    
- Setup NFS to share the [volume](../../volume) directory.     
- Each swarm node must mount the [volume](../../volume) directory at the same absolute path.    

Finally, start/stop services as follows:
```
make start_docker_swarm
make stop_docker_swarm
```

### Docker Swam Single Machine Deployment with VCAC-A

Initialize VCAC-A node setup if you have not:
```
script/setup-vcac-a.sh
```

Update the Image to the VCAC-A node:
```
script/update-image.sh
```

Then start/stop services as follows:
```
make start_docker_swarm
make stop_docker_swarm
```
